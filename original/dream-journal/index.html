<h3>2023-12-21</h3>

<p>A gruesome illness where people's organs turned against them, exploding the body in a mess of gore. Some organs managed to live outside of the bodies, usually torturing people to death. Those who could survive this quickly regenerated their body, only to explode again.</p>

<p>I was a scientist studying the illness and found a cure that prevented the explosions but turned its sufferers into giant animals. I quit my job and on my way to the subway station wondered if I had my pass card with me. When I confirmed that I had, I realized I was dreaming.</p>

<h3>2023-12-20</h3>

<p>Fire alarms all around me and my nails were painted in a color that kept changing.</p>

<h3>2023-12-15</h3>

<p>A classmate of mine didn't know how to read or write and the teachers made every student try to teach him. Whoever could do so would win a candy bar.</p>
            
<h3>2023-12-13</h3>

<p>I was in a fistfight, but used the Pokkén Tournament controls to move my body.</p>

<h3>2023-11-26</h3>

<p>I was a group of anthropomorphic feline space explorers. I explored the galaxies in an attempt to gather resources for my dying home planet.</p>
        
<p>I landed on a verdant planet, exiting the spaceship and exploring its jungles. The planet looked handpainted rather than real, in the same art style as the Fear and Hunger games.</p>
        
<h3>2023-11-21</h3>
    
<p>I was a dog on a hunt with my owner. I stepped on a makeshift grave for a baby whose head was blown out.</p>

<h3>2023-11-19</h3>

<p>My family had only 45€ left to live.</p>

<h3>2023-11-06</h3>

<p>Me and [♥] were called out on Twitter for drawing questionable porn while on vacation in an underground mall with stairs leading down to a giant pool.</p>

<h3>2023-11-05</h3>

<p>I was a neckbeard playing a video game that doesn't exist on Twitch, and there was a boss- a woman on the back of a bull- that was brutally difficult and told me to «escape» before I lost, zoned out and woke up in my bed. I figured the Twitch stream was a dream, to my surprise there were clips of me losing over and over on there.</p>

<p>Before I could stream again, the video game boss bust down my front door. I asked her why, and she told me I hadn't escaped properly.</p>

<p>I ran away from my house, dedicating months to bodybuilding. Next time I played the game, I was able to defeat the boss, violently ripping the woman apart and scaring off the bull. I was a giant focused on violence now, and ate all of those who were weaker than me.</p>

<h3>2023-09-27</h3>

<p>Watched a Chris Chan video where she was doing a AMA. She was asked what she did to relax, to which her answer was fishing.</p>

<p>Me and [♥] went fishing after watching the video, and had a nice time.</p>
