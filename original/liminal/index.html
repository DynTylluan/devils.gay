<h3>Dead mall</h3>
    
<p>During my childhood and early teenage years, I lived on an apartment complex which had a two floor shopping mall on the ground and B1 floors. It was a bustling place early on, with a supermarket, many stores and restaurants and a movie theatre.</p>
    
<p>However, due to poor management, all those places began closing down. First went the movie theatre, then the supermarket... all shops closed down, until the last restaurant moved to another location.</p>
    
<p>The day after that restaurant closed, I was passing through the B1 floor as a shortcut. The white walls and tiled floor, along with all the dirty, tape-covered windows, on an empty space once meant for crowds of people was all I could see.</p>
    
<h3>Empty bus</h3>
    
<p>Coming back from art school late at night, on a route that not many travelled on. That night, I was the only passenger.</p>
    
<p>The radio was barely audible from my seat. As the bus passed the stops before mine, I stared out the window. I wished the driver good night when I arrived at my stop.</p>
    
<h3>Path to school</h3>
    
<p>When the classes hadn't started yet and I had just applied to that school, I had to go through an empty balcony with many stairs and plants. The walls of the buildings surroundind the area were white, as was the floor. The sun was setting.</p>
   
<p>Needless to say, when the classes started the area became a lot more lively.</p>
