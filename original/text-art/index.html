<p>Text art, more commonly referred to as ASCII art (which is not a very accurate name as not all text art is derived from ASCII), is an art form in which pictures are created out of printable characters.</p>
    
<p>Despite being heavily associated with computers and Internet culture, there is evidence proving that the art form predates them, appearing inthe 1960s. Some sources suggest that it might've been even earlier, coinciding with the creation of the typewriter.</p>
    
<p>This technique was invented in large part because early printers didn't often have the ability to print images, and so the authors replaced traditional photos with pictures made with characters instead.</p>

<!--(R)TTY and line printers-->

<h2 id="printers">(R)TTY and line printers</h2>

<p>The Teletype and Radioteletype (they were very similar, one simply used wires and the other radio waves), often shortened to TTY and RTTY, and the line printer were the oldest tools to create text art with.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/tty.jpg" alt="Rendition of Dag Hammarskjöld." title="Rendition of Dag Hammarskjöld.">
    <figcaption>An example of TTY art.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>TTY printers used character sets such as Baudot code, predating ASCII. The 1972 RTTY Handbook claims that the TTY has produced text images as early as 1923, although none of these images have been found yet. It's not impossible that teletype artwork was created back then, but unfortunately both traditional fan-fold computer paper and old roll-style teletype paper are not acid-free and as such archival is near impossible as they fade into yellow with time.</p>

<p>Around the same time, in the 1960s, one of the first text images made on an IBM 1403 line printer was published by Andries van Dam. Also on line printers, Kenneth Knowlton was known to create realistic images by overprinting several characters on top of one another.</p>

<figure class="center">

    <figcaption>An example of line printer art. This example was produced by Samuel P. Harbison in 1973 and was printed in 3 sections.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The character sets available in the IBM 1403 were derived from EBCDIC rather than ASCII, despite some similarities.</p>

<p>These works of art weren't always handmade, some were scanned with tools such as the drum-scanning densitometer and later converted to overstrike form.</p>

<p>Preserving these pieces is a complicated process. One such process involves converting overstrike art into Adobe Illustrator files, so the images can load easily on modern computers, be resized, have the font reset and be printed on laser printers.</p>

<!--ASCII art-->

<h2 id="ascii">ASCII</h2>

<p>The use of ASCII art can be traced to bulletin board systems of the late 1970s and 1980s, as the computers of the time had limitations that did not allow for images.</p>

<p>Besides being used in communication, ASCII also appeared in underground online art communities, starting a new age of the text art phenomenon.</p>

<p>ASCII art, unlike Unicode, rely on the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963. These characters, seen in the image below, can be very limiting for beginners, as modern computers allow for a myriad of characters that don't exist in ASCII.</p>

<img src="/images//extra/ascii-set.png" alt="The 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126." title="The 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126." class="center">

<p>During the 1990s, there was a decline in ASCII art with the rise in popularity of graphical browsing and variable-width fonts. However, ASCII art was still used in MUDs, IRC, e-mail, message boards... in short, any online communication that employed fixed-width fonts.</p>

<p>As the years progressed, ASCII art became more complex. Some would create ASCII comics, and later colored ASCII art and even animations started being created within this scene.</p>

<figure class="center">

<!--Braille ASCII and Block Elements-->

<h3 id="braille">Braille ASCII and Block Elements</h3>

<p>The braille subset of the ASCII uses 64 of the printable ASCII characters to represent all dot combinations in six-dot braille. Originating in North America around 1969, it is used internationally in modern times.</p>

<p>Although less commonly used in ASCII art, it has been used to create images, often accompanied by Block Elements such as █.</p>

</figure>

<!--ANSI-->

<h3 id="ansi">ANSI</h3>

<p>ANSI escape sequences are used to control cursor location, color, font styling and other options on video text terminals. This relates to ASCII art as ANSI was a staple of early computers, and as such the earliest forms of ASCII art were created in terminals.</p>

<p>Such examples are seen to this day on the CLI app Neofetch, displaying the logo of the user's OS.</p>

<figure class="center">

<!--ATASCII and PETSCII-->

<h2 id="ata-petscii">ATASCII and PETSCII</h2>

<p>The Atari 400/800 did not follow the ASCII standard, and the same can be said for the Commodore 64. Instead, they used ATASCII and PETSCII respectively and developed into their own subgenres of the text art scene.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/atascii-set.gif" alt="The character set of ATASCII, upscaled." title="The character set of ATASCII, upscaled." style="height:  200px;">

    <figcaption>The ATASCII (left) and PETSCII (right) character sets.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They differ from ASCII as they contain symbol characters, such as the ♥. Some Atari sceners even created ATASCII animations, referred to as «break animations».</p>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>PETSCII art has two main styles: line drawings and text mosaics. The former is a lot simpler-looking, and looks similar to the traditional ASCII art, and text mosaics can picture incredibly complex scenes. Nowadays, there is a growing community of PETSCII artists due to more programs dedicated to creating this kind of art being created.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/petscii-line.png" alt="The Pokémon Dragonite made out of green lines." title="The Pokémon Dragonite made out of green lines." style="height: 170px;">

Note that the program it used to create these allows for custom color palettes, and isn't necessarily representative of how it would look like on a C64.</figcaption>
</figure>

<!--Shift JIS-->

<h2 id="shift-jis">Shift JIS</h2>

<p>Shift JIS is a character set that, besides plain ASCII, contain characters from Japanese script and fullwidth ASCII characters. It is usually seen in Japanese websites.</p>

<p>Since the character set contains a larger array of characters, text art using Shift JIS can be a lot more complex than most ASCII art. Artists have a lot more freedom with this set, and since it was easily accessible in Japan it naturally made Shift JIS art very popular in Japanese websites such as 2channel (especially through the 2000s).</p>

<p>In 2channel, a large text art culture formed, creating iconic text art characters such as Gikoneko and Monā. In the late 2010s a newfound appreciation for these characters emerged, especially in the Western side of the Web, years after the end of 2channel.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/shift-jis.png" alt="A Shift JIS artwork picturing a character laying down in a flower field, with mountains seen in the distance." title="A Shift JIS artwork picturing a character laying down in a flower field, with mountains seen in the distance.">
    <figcaption>An example of Shift JIS art.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Additionally, this kind of artwork is meant to be viewed with a font such as the MS P Gothic and other proportional Japanese fonts.</p>

<!--Unicode-->

<h2 id="unicode">Unicode</h2>

<p>Unicode is a text encoding standard maintained by the Unicode Consortium. With over 1.1 million characters (including emoji), it is the kind of text art that offers the most freedom.</p>

<p>However, finding a fixed-width font (a staple in text art) is a harder task in Unicode. Not only that, Unicode art cannot be displayed in a .TXT file as it needs an encoding (such as the widely used UTF-8) to process and store as binary data. This is because Unicode is not an actual character set.</p>

<p>Despite these setbacks, Unicode art is widely used for emoticons and kaomoji, as it allows for accurate representations of several different things (such as emotions or animals) with very few characters.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/unicode.jpg" alt="A Kaomoji picturing a cat with its paws up." title="A Kaomoji picturing a cat with its paws up.">
    <figcaption>An example of Unicode art.</figcaption>
